          Gene-gene co-expression networks (GCN) are of biological interest for the useful information they provide for understanding gene-gene interactions.
          In this project, we constructed a new semiparametric scRNA-seq data simulation tool named ESCO, 
          which ensembles current state of art in the first moment characterization, 
          and fills in the gap of depicting higher order gene-gene interaction using a copula model.

          Experimentation in E-commerce often have extra consideration of revenue constrain and time constrain. 
          In this project we utilized recent advances in reinforcement learning and any-time valid inference to 
          construct an online experimentation platform that allows efficient trading off between revenue constrain 
          and time constrain in E-commerce. We also proposed new algorithm to deal with unknown abrupt changes over time, 
          which only cost O(1) for each updates, and has much lower regret comparing with other state-of-arts.

            Biological research often involves testing a growing number of null hypotheses as new data is accumulated over time. 
            We study the problem of online control of the familywise error rate (FWER), that is testing an apriori unbounded sequence of hypotheses (p-values) one by one 
            over time without knowing the future, such that with high probability there are no false discoveries in the entire sequence.
            In this project we unified algorithmic concepts developed for offline FWER control and online FDR control to develop new powerful, 
            adaptive online FWER control method. We also formally proved the substantial gains of power of the new methods, 
            and derived closed form of effective hyper-parameters for optimizing the power in a Gaussian sequence model.

          <p>  
            Major internet companies routinely perform tens of thousands of A/B tests each year, and rapid data collection is making the online testing of hypotheses increasingly essential. 
            In this project we proposed a new online FDR control algorithm called ADDIS that adapts to both signal proportion and conservative nulls and has wide validity: 
            works under either independence or local-dependence; synchrony or asynchrony. 
            ADDIS outperforms current state of arts in terms of robustness as well as power.

        <p><b>Gaussian Graphical Structure Recovery via Knockoffs with Corrupted Data</b>

        <p>
          Learning the dependence structures in Gaussian graphical models is of fundamental importance in many contemporary applications. 
          In this project, we proposed new procedure called CoCoKnockoff to recover the high dimensional gaussian graphical structure with FDR 
          control given data with additive measurement error and unknown population covariance. With theoretical gauratees for FDR control, 
          numerical studies show that CoCoKnockoff enjoy better statistical power compared with directly using the knockoff method.

        <tt>Jinjin Tian, Jing Lei, Kehui Chen</tt> &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          In this project, we demonstrated that the brain regions connectivity can be a good measure to classify the brain undertaking different tasks: 
          using the brain structure to guide connections design between layers in deep learning model can significantly improve the classification accuracy 
          and prevent overfitting. The results imply the potentials of the structure of network in  classification of realtional data.
